Image placeholders needed:

1. digital_twin-1024x1536.webp - Large marketplace image (exactly 1024x1536)
2. digital_twin-256x256.webp - Bot avatar (exactly 256x256)

These should be created with proper branding showing a digital twin concept.
For now, the bot will install without images (empty base64 strings in install file).
